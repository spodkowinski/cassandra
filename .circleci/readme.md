# CircleCI config files

## Used config files

This directory contains the editable config file `config-2_1.yml` that can be
converted to the effective `config.yml` by using 
the [CircleCI CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#install):

```
circleci config process config-2_1.yml > config.yml
```

Always keep a working `config.yml` committed - do not edit this file manually!

## Install commit hook for patching config settings (optional)

Custom patches for changing the yaml config can be applied automatically from a
git commit hook by installing the following script, or by running the script manually:

```
cp .circleci/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This will apply all patches in the directory to the original config, before using
the CLI tool for creating the converted, final config file.

You'll need the [CircleCI CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#install)
installed to make this work!
